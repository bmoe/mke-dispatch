# Milwaukee Police Department Dispatch 

This is a project to provide a more generally useful interface to the live data feed of call dispatch provided by the Milwaukee Police Department ([link](http://itmdapps.milwaukee.gov/MPDCallData/currentCADCalls/callsService.faces)).  A running example of this project can be found [here](https://mke-police.herokuapp.com/).

The goals of the project are:

* Allow viewing of dispatch records across any time period (Dataset provided by the MPD is limited to most recent 90 minutes)
* Map dispatch records across any time period
* Allow bulk download of raw call logs (json and csv formats) across any time period
